# Meteorite-Landings

This Python program parses through a text file which contains meteorite landing information from NASA. After parsing the file, the program gets all the meteorite landing data from a given latitude and longitude coordinate and a given radius.

Meteorite landings on earth are so epically cool. I sometimes wish that I could see one with own eyes. I hear that once upon a time, a kid by the name of Daopaslowla had come to keel some hut hut monsters. Then there is no more to this awesome story.
